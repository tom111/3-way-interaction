Welcome to the webpage of our seminar.  Your organizers are [Carlos Amendola](http://www.luke-amendola.appspot.com/), [Eliana Duarte](https://emduart2.github.io/) and [Thomas Kahle](https://thomas-kahle.de/).

Here's our line-up:

## Next: January 16, 2023

- Location:	MPI-MiS Leipzig
- Time: 2pm
- Speaker: [Peter Stadler (U Leipzig)](https://www.bioinf.uni-leipzig.de/~studla/)
- Title: Relational Data in Phylogentics
- Abstract: In the course of investigation evolutionary relationships found in 
the genomes a set of species, several binary relations appear.
For example "best matches" refer pairs of genes x and y so that 
y is one of the closest relatives of x in the species that harbors y.
Orthology designates pairs of genes whose last common ancestor 
is a speciation event. Horizontal gene transfer is related to 
the lower diverence time relation, satisfied by a pair of genes 
that is younger than the divergence of the species in which they
reside. I will sketch the connections between the relations and 
the the information that they convey about the gene trees, the 
phylogeny of the underlying species, and the reconciliation of 
gene and species trees.
